= Exporting

== Vector graphic

To export an annotated spectrum click the export button in the top left corner. This opens the system print dialog. Make sure to enable background graphics otherwise some elements may be missing in the export. Choose print to pdf and save the file. This file can be opened in any vector graphics application for manual touch ups.

== Data

Once a spectrum is annotated the selected spectrum can be saved as a mzSpecLib, MGF, or mzML file. mzSpecLib files contain the spectrum and the peak annotations. MGF and mzML contain only the spectrum.
